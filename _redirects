# Cloudflare Pages Redirects
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/redirects/

# Note: Configure www to non-www redirect in Cloudflare Dashboard
# Go to: Pages > Your Project > Custom domains
# Add both cigarro.in and www.cigarro.in as custom domains
# Cloudflare will automatically handle the www redirect

# SPA routing is handled automatically by Cloudflare Pages
# Static assets (/assets/*, /images/*, etc.) are served directly
# Functions in /functions/ directory are served automatically
# All other routes fall back to index.html automatically
